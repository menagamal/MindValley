# Why VIPER?

After using VIPER, I've found it to be very beneficial in many ways. Letâ€™s get back to the list of things we set out to accomplish when architecting our app to see if VIPER addresses them.

  - Easy to iterate on
  - Collaboration friendly
  - Separated out concerns
- Spec-ability
